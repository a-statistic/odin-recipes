    <h1>Fantaun</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Home Page</a></p>
    <img src="../images/fantuan.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This is my personal favorite. It is a dish local to Taiwan. Fan, meaning rice, and tuan, meaning ball
        This is exactly that, but the taste is so much more. If I had to pic only one food the eat the rest of my life,
        it probably wouldn't be this, but I would consider it briefly. 
    </p>
    <p>Fantaun is a popular breakfast dish in Taiwan that can easily be found in the open air markets or
        small breakfast shops literally everywhere. If you go, you need to try it! Seriously. Or the next best thing,
        find this real recipe online and make it.
