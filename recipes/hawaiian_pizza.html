    <h3>A dish everyone loves to hate</h3>
    <p>Hawaiian Pizza is a fusion of sweet and savory, with a bit more tang than your average pizza. 
        Either you love this pizza, or you love to hate it. There is no in between. 
    </p>
    <p>I wonder if Hawaiian pizza was made in Hawaii, or it just carries the name because of the added pineapples.
        Hawaii isnt the only place with pineapples. anyway, to the recipe!
    </p>
    <h3>Some of the ingredients</h3>
